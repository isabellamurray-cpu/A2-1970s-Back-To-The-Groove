# A2 1970s Back To The Groove
By Isabella Murray â€“ 52685 Working with Data and Code

Back to the Groove is a coded musical composition created in TunePad, a browser-based Python environment for making music. This project recreates iconic styles from the 1970s through coded rhythm, melody, and harmony. Each section of the song is programmed using loops, functions, and parameters to control timing, pitch, and texture. The goal was to explore how code can act as a creative instrument, allowing me to compose, structure, and perform using logic rather than traditional notation.

# Project Rationale 
This work was inspired by the structure and sound of 1970s popular music, a decade defined by groove, repetition, and experimentation. By translating these features into Python code, the project investigates how coding can express musical ideas. I used TunePad because it allows quick iteration, visual playback, and layering of multiple musical tracks (drums, bass, chords). This helped me focus on musical logic and creative structure rather than technical setup.
